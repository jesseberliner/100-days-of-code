# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - Jesse Berliner

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 1, Friday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
Learned: Directly manipulating the DOM with JavaScript
New Resources: Scrimba's JavaScript BootCamp

### R1D2
Learned: Fetch() to get data from an API and how async/await improves fetch()


### R1D3
Learned: Began first project with Scrimba's JavaScript BootCamp, did some challenges on array methods
New Resources: FreeCodeCamp's Functional Programming challenges


### R1D4
Learned: Finished watching project for Scrimba, worked on FreeCodeCamp's challenges.  Filter() is much easier for me than reduce()


### R1D5
Learned: Finished Functional Programming section of FreeCodeCamp's challenges, started Intermediate Algorithm Scripting Challenges

### R1D6
Learned: Some Scrimba ('this' and import/export), some FreeCodeCamp, a bit of CSS
New Resources: CSS Diner (https://flukeout.github.io/)

### R1D7
Learned: Very basics of state.  Also learned that it's very easy to create a basic app (just red "Hello World" with an alert)

### R1D8
Learned: Basics of HTML and CSS, yet again.  Maybe, since I'm actually using it, it'll stick this time.

### R1D9
Learned: HTML and CSS, finished Scrimba's HTML and CSS crash course.  Needed the refresher.  Tomorrow (or later today) I'll go back to the Roman Numeral to Decimal converter project I 'started' on Day 7
